Pulp Python Support
===================

Welcome to the Pulp Python Plugin documentation. These plugins extend the
:ref:`Pulp Project <platform:pulp_documentation>` so that it is capable of handling Python packages.
With these plugins, you can create Python repositories in Pulp, upload Python packages to those
repositories, and use pip to install packages from client machines.

We plan to add support for more features in the future, and community contributions are welcome.
Send us pull requests on `our GitHub repository <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_python>`_. See existing
bugs in the `Pulp's Redmine <https://pulp.plan.io/projects/pulp_python/issues?set_filter=1&tracker_id=1>`_
instance or file a `new bug <https://pulp.plan.io/projects/pulp_python/issues/new>`_.
